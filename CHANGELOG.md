CHANGELOG
=========

1.2.0

  return the disposition of the transaction as set by the custom rules for the
  account.

1.1.1 (2016-10-17)
------------------

* Correctly set the IP address risk for the Score model. Previously, it
  always returned `null`.

1.1.0 (2016-10-11)
------------------

* Added the follow new values to the event type validation: `email_change` and
  `password_reset`.
* `isset()` on model attributes now returns the correct value.

------------------

* First production release. No code changes.

0.6.2 (2016-08-17)
------------------

* Added the following new values to the payment processor validation:
  `concept_payments`, `ecomm365`, `orangepay`, and `pacnet_services`.
* Upgraded `maxmind/web-service-common` to 0.3.0. This version uses
  `composer/ca-bundle` rather than our own CA bundle.

0.6.1 (2016-06-10)
------------------

* BREAKING CHANGE: `creditsRemaining` has been removed from the web service
  models and has been replaced by `queriesRemaining`.
* Added `queriesRemaining` and `fundsRemaining`. Note that `fundsRemaining`
  will not be returned by the web service until our new credit system is in
  place.

0.5.0 (2016-05-23)
------------------

  `ccnow`, `dalpay`, `epay` (replaces `epayeu`), `payplus`, `pinpayments`,
  `quickpay`, and `verepay`.

0.4.0 (2016-01-20)
------------------

* PHP 7 support was added. PHP 5.3 support was dropped.
* Previously an array within an array would incorrectly validate when using
  the `->with*` methods. This now correctly throws a validation exception.
