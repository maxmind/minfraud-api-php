namespace MaxMind\MinFraud\Model;

/**
 * Model of the Score response.
 *
 * @property-read integer $fundsRemaining The approximate US dollar value of the
 * funds remaining on your MaxMind account.
 *
 * @property-read integer $queriesRemaining The approximate number of queries
 * remaining for this service before your account runs out of funds.
 *
 * @property-read integer $rawResponse The raw data that comes back from the post
 * request to the maxmind server.
 *
 * @property-read string $id This is a UUID that identifies the minFraud request.
 * Please use this ID in bug reports or support requests to MaxMind so that we
 * can easily identify a particular request.
 *
 * @property-read float $riskScore This property contains the risk score, from 0.01
 * to 99. A higher score indicates a higher risk of fraud. For example, a
 * score of 20 indicates a 20% chance that a transaction is fraudulent. We
 * never return a risk score of 0, since all transactions have the possibility
 * of being fraudulent. Likewise we never return a risk score of 100.
 *
 * @property-read \MaxMind\MinFraud\Model\Disposition disposition An object
 * containing the disposition set by custom rules.
 *
 * @property-read \MaxMind\MinFraud\Model\ScoreIpAddress $ipAddress An object
 * containing the IP risk for the transaction.
 *
 * @property-read array $warnings This array contains
 * {@link \MaxMind\MinFraud\Model\Warning Warning} objects detailing issues
 * with the request that was sent, such as invalid or unknown inputs. It
 * is highly recommended that you check this array for issues when integrating
 * the web service.
